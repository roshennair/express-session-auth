# Express Session Authentication

This is a demo project I created to learn basic Express session-based authentication, primary utilizing the [express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session) NPM package.

**DISCLAIMER**: I did not develop this Node.js app myself, I created it as a code-along project for Code Realm's amazing YouTube tutorial, [Session Authentication in Express](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH6Z0dJ_Huk).
